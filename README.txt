fnd_duplicate_photos.command

I wrote this with only 'man bash', no online reference material (Stuck in Annapurna Base
Camp and entertaining myself). I'm sure it is garbage to any veteran scripter. I make no
guarantees to reliability or safety but it is safe.

Apple Photos removed the ability to search its Master photo library for duplicate photos.
This script will search any directory you choose but defaults to the Photos Library Master
photo directory and searches for jpep, mp4, mov, mpeg and avi files that are duplicated
and outputs the list to a file of your choosing (Default, ~/Desktop/dupicate_photos_list.txt)

This script will not move or modify any files, it just gives you a list of duplicates
If you want to do anything to the duplicate file, see the commented out line in the script:
##DO WHATEVER YOU WISH TO DUPLICATE FILES HERE##
I've made a few suggestions you can uncomment.

Options:
-d <search_directory> -- path of directory to search for duplicate files
-o <output_file> -- path to output duplicate file list generated by this script
-s <number> -- number of bytes to compare in each file !! too low a number will generate
               false positives
-t <"file_ext"> -- Default file extensions are "jp*g mp*g avi mp4 mov" this is case
                 insensitive. Use -t to override defaults. Use spaces to separate
                 extensions and quote multiple exts. *'s are allowed (see defaults).
-h, -?, --help -- I'm not going to dignify this

Example: fnd_duplicate_photos.command -d ~/Desktop/camera -t "jp*g png" -o /tmp/diff.txt -s 4096
will search ~/Desktop/camera for jpeg, jpg and png files. It will compare the first 4k bytes
of every file and a list of identical files will be output to /tmp/diff.txt
